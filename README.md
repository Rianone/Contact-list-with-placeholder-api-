# FILTERABLE CONTACT LIST WITH FETCH API, JSON PLACEHOLDER AND LOCAL STORAGE

## Description
Fully responsive and mobile first asynchronous contact list where you can add,read,update and delete contacts from the contact list.
Since AJAX permits us to do requests to the server asynchronously(via XMLHTTP requests) we will charge info from the JSON placeholder, you do not need to reload the page after any action(CRUD). The contacts are stored in the local storage where they are read and displayed on the web page at any moment.
